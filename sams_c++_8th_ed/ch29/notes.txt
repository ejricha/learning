Quiz:
1. If your application doesn't respond, you should throw an exception. Then, you should figure out if there were two threads that were deadlocked, or some other multi-threading error. If the image processing is done in the same thread as the UI, then it might appear unresponsive, and could be split into multiple threads.
2. For multithreaded access, make sure that you have a mutex around each critical section, so that no other thread has access while one thread is writing. Multiple threads can read at the same time with a shared_mutex, though.
