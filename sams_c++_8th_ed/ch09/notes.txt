Quiz:
1. On the heap (the free store).
2. No, sizeof() will report the same size, because int* is a pointer (constant size).
3. Only class member functions can access private class members.
4. Yes, one class member method can invoke another.
5. A constructor is good for initializing data members and resources.
6. A destructor is good for releasing resources and deallocating memory.

Exercises:
1. "Class Human" should be "class Human", since C++ is case-sensitive. It also needs to end with a semicolon.
2. "int age;" is inaccessible outside the class, since it is a private member variable;
3. Better version of the class:
class Human {
 public:
  Human() : name("Bob"), age(20) { }
  Human(string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) { }

 private:
  int age;
  string name;
};
4. See ex04.cpp:
$ ./ex04.bin
