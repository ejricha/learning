Quiz:
1. To force all derived classes to implement functions Area() and Print(), make them pure virtual in the base class.
2. No, a compiler only creates a Virtual Function Table (vtable) for classes that have at least one virtual function.
3. A class with any pure virtual functions is an abstract base class, since it cannot be instantiated.

Exercises:
1. See below:
class Shape {
 public:
  virtual int Area() = 0;
  virtual void Print() = 0;
};
class Circle : public Shape {
 public:
  int Area() override { ... }
  int Print() override { ... }
};
// class Triangle is just like class Circle
2. The base class destructor should always be declared virtual.
3. Order of constructors and destructors:
Vehicle() -> Car() -> ~Vehicle()
