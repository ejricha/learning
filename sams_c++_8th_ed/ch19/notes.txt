Quiz:
1. For the default sort operator in set<int>, it is really set<int, less<int>>.
2. Duplicate elements in a multiset would be stored right next to each other, because it is a BST.
3. set/multiset.size() returns the number of elements in the container.

Exercises:
1. Just use phone_number in operator==() and operator<() functions:
$ ./ex01.bin 
 John Travolta: +1 234 4563 789
 Ben Affleck: +1 745 641 314
 Jack Welsch: +1 7889 879 879
 Bill Gates: +1 97 7897 8799 8
 Angi Merkel: +49 23456 5466
 Vlad Putin: +7 6645 4564 789
Enter a phone number you wish to delete: +1 97 7897 8799 8
Displaying contacts after erasing +1 97 7897 8799 8
 John Travolta: +1 234 4563 789
 Ben Affleck: +1 745 641 314
 Jack Welsch: +1 7889 879 879
 Angi Merkel: +49 23456 5466
 Vlad Putin: +7 6645 4564 789
2. Use a multiset to define a dictionary:
$ ./ex02.bin 
 do : A deer, a female deer
Enter a word ('x' to quit): cat
Enter a definition: A lumpy thing that sleeps all day
 cat : A lumpy thing that sleeps all day
 do : A deer, a female deer
Enter a word ('x' to quit): potato
Enter a definition: A word I say a lot
 cat : A lumpy thing that sleeps all day
 do : A deer, a female deer
 potato : A word I say a lot
Enter a word ('x' to quit): potato
Enter a definition: Another lumpy thing, that you eat
 cat : A lumpy thing that sleeps all day
 do : A deer, a female deer
 potato : A word I say a lot
 potato : Another lumpy thing, that you eat
Enter a word ('x' to quit): x
Exiting, dictionary has:
 cat : A lumpy thing that sleeps all day
 do : A deer, a female deer
 potato : A word I say a lot
 potato : Another lumpy thing, that you eat
