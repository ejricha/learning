Quiz:
1. Indenting keeps code better organized, allowing you to quickly see which sections belong with which blocks.
2. Don't use goto since it makes for hard-to-read code.
3. Yes, a decrementing for loop would look like this:
   for (int j = 20; j > 0; --j) { ... }
4. The loop will never start, because counter is initialized to 0 and it checks that counter == 0 before starting.

Exercises:
1. for (int i = N-1; i >= 0; --i) {
     cout << "a[" << i << "] = " << a[i] << "\n";
   }
2. $ ./ex02.bin 
Adding each int in myNums1 to each int in myNums2, in reverse order:
0 + -1 = -1
0 + 20 = 20
-3 + -1 = -4
-3 + 20 = 17
35 + -1 = 34
35 + 20 = 55
3. $ ./ex03.bin 
How many Fibonacci Numbers would you like to calculate? 10
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 
Goodbye!
4. $ for n in 0 1 6 7; do echo $n | ./ex04.bin; done
Enter a number 1 through 6: Invalid rainbow color (0)
Enter a number 1 through 6: Red (1) is a color in the rainbow
Enter a number 1 through 6: Purple (6) is a color in the rainbow
Enter a number 1 through 6: Invalid rainbow color (7)
5. The conditional statement says "counter=10", which is an assignment, instead of "counter == 10".
6. The while statement has a semicolon after it, so the loopCounter is never incremented, the while loop will run forever, and the code block after it will never be executed.
7. It is missing a break statement.
